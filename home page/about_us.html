            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a team of dedicated individuals from the University of Moratuwa, working on revolutionizing agriculture with real-time soil monitoring technology. Our project, "Revolutionizing Agriculture with Real-Time Soil Monitoring Technology," aims to develop an innovative automated soil monitoring solution to optimize soil moisture and temperature for agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.</p>
            <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify and prioritize key factors influencing soil moisture and temperature levels crucial for plant growth.</li>
                <li>Integrate appropriate sensors for soil moisture and temperature measurements into a compact soil monitoring device.</li>
                <li>Develop a user-friendly interface for displaying real-time soil moisture and temperature measurements.</li>
                <li>Test the device's performance and accuracy in measuring soil moisture and temperature under various soil and environmental conditions.</li>
                <li>Develop an offline data storage with online synchronization to ensure continuous data collection and accessibility.</li>
                <li>Refine the design based on feedback to optimize usability and reliability for soil moisture and temperature monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
